# Day 2. Variable selection for analysis of high-dimensional genomic sequencing data.

---

Today, we will start from subset selection to selection probabilty analyzing
high-dimensional genomic sequencing data.

We will assume that you have basic R programming skills, which can be obtained
by taking a free online course
[Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) or
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=r%20programming).
