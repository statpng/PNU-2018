# Day 2. Regularization for analysis of high-dimensional genomic data

---

Today, we will start from taking a look at regularzation methods filtering variant calls to analyzing single
cell RNA-seq data across various contexts of high-throughput genomic
analysis.

We will assume that you have basic UNIX skills, which can be obtained
by taking a free online course
[HERE](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line), but
we we will guide from the beginning, just in case you may get lost
from the beginning.
